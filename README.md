SDLRaytracer
============

Very simple raytracer using SDL in C

This project is for my own learning purposes only. Raytracing component will be based of a little javascript piece I wrote
for figuring out how "raytracing" works. I haven't actually done much with SDL or Git before either.

Goal is to be able render spheres with multiple light sources and maybe add some kind of reflection (phong?).
